# 🌐 Site Management Feature

Your SEO Optimize app now includes site management functionality where users can add, view, and manage their websites for SEO analysis.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Add Sites** - Users can add websites with URL and optional title
- ✅ **View Sites** - Display all user sites in a clean grid layout
- ✅ **Delete Sites** - Remove sites with confirmation
- ✅ **User Isolation** - Each user only sees their own sites (RLS)
- ✅ **Real-time Updates** - Sites appear immediately after adding

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The `sites` table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sites (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  url TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled
- Users can only access their own sites
- Automatic user_id assignment on insert
- Cascade delete when user is deleted

## 🎯 How It Works
