# Cancelled Audit Usage Fix

## Problem
Previously, when users started an audit and then cancelled it (by navigating away or clicking the cancel button), the audit would still count against their usage limits even though they didn't receive the complete audit results. This was unfair to users, especially those on the Free Tier with limited audits.

## Solution
Modified the audit API to only record audit usage and save audit results when the request hasn't been cancelled. This ensures that:

1. **Cancelled audits don't count against limits**
2. **Incomplete audit records aren't saved to database**
3. **Users only pay for completed audits**

## Technical Implementation

### Changes Made to `src/app/api/audit/route.ts`

#### 1. **Audit Result Saving**
```typescript
// Before: Always saved audit results
const { data: savedAudit, error: saveError } = await saveAuditResultServer(auditResult, siteId, effectiveUserId)

// After: Only save if not cancelled
if (!request.signal?.aborted) {
  const { data: savedAudit, error: saveError } = await saveAuditResultServer(auditResult, siteId, effectiveUserId)
  // ... save logic
} else {
  console.log('Audit request was cancelled - not saving result')
}
```

#### 2. **Usage Recording**
```typescript
// Before: Always recorded usage
await SubscriptionService.recordAuditUsage(effectiveUserId, url)

// After: Only record if not cancelled
if (!request.signal?.aborted) {
  await SubscriptionService.recordAuditUsage(effectiveUserId, url)
  console.log('Audit usage recorded')
} else {
  console.log('Audit request was cancelled - not recording usage')
}
```

### Key Changes

#### **PSI Audit Section**
- Added abort check before saving audit result
- Added abort check before recording usage
- Added logging for cancelled requests

#### **HTTP Audit Fallback Section**
- Added abort check before saving audit result
- Added abort check before recording usage
- Added logging for cancelled requests

#### **Error Handling**
- Maintained proper try-catch structure
- Added specific logging for cancelled operations
- Preserved existing error handling for non-cancelled requests

## User Experience Benefits

### 1. **Fair Usage Counting**
- Users only consume audit credits for completed audits
- Cancelled audits (navigation away, manual cancel) don't count
- Network interruptions don't waste audit credits

### 2. **Database Efficiency**
- Incomplete audit records aren't saved
- Reduces database clutter from cancelled operations
- Only successful audits are stored for history

### 3. **Resource Optimization**
- Server doesn't waste resources on cancelled requests
- Audit usage tracking is more accurate
- Better system performance overall

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Manual Cancellation**
```
1. Start audit
2. Click "Cancel Audit" button
3. Verify usage count doesn't increase
4. Verify no audit record saved
```

### 2. **Navigation Cancellation**
```
1. Start audit
2. Navigate away from page (confirm leaving)
3. Verify usage count doesn't increase
4. Verify no audit record saved
```

### 3. **Network Interruption**
```
1. Start audit
2. Disconnect network
3. Verify usage count doesn't increase
4. Verify no incomplete record saved
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **Race Conditions**
- Abort check happens before usage recording
- Multiple abort checks throughout the process
- Proper cleanup of resources

### 2. **Partial Completion**
- If audit completes but response is cancelled, still no usage recorded
- Audit result generation and usage recording are atomic
- Either both happen or neither happens

### 3. **Error Scenarios**
- Cancelled requests return HTTP 499 status
- Different from actual audit failures (HTTP 500)
- Proper error logging for debugging

## Monitoring and Logging

### **Success Logs**
```
✅ "Audit usage recorded for authenticated user"
✅ "Audit result saved to database"
```

### **Cancellation Logs**
```
ℹ️ "Audit request was cancelled - not recording usage"
ℹ️ "Audit request was cancelled - not saving result"
```

### **Error Logs**
```
❌ "Failed to record audit usage" (for actual errors)
❌ "Failed to save audit result" (for actual errors)
```

## Implementation Details

### **Abort Signal Checking**
The fix uses `request.signal?.aborted` to check if the client has cancelled the request. This is a standard web API that works with:

- Browser navigation away from page
- Manual cancellation via AbortController
- Network timeouts and interruptions
- Component unmounting in React

### **Database Consistency**
The fix ensures that:
- Audit records and usage tracking are consistent
- No orphaned records from cancelled operations
- Usage limits accurately reflect completed audits

### **Performance Impact**
- Minimal overhead (simple boolean check)
- Reduces unnecessary database operations
- Improves overall system efficiency

## Future Considerations

### **Enhanced Cancellation**
- Could add partial audit result saving for resume functionality
- Could implement audit queuing for background processing
- Could add more granular cancellation points

### **User Feedback**
- Could show saved audit credits when cancellation occurs
- Could provide better cancellation confirmation
- Could add audit history with cancellation status

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that users are only charged for audit credits when they receive complete audit results. Cancelled audits (whether by user action or technical issues) no longer count against usage limits, making the system fairer and more user-friendly.

The implementation is robust, handles edge cases properly, and maintains backward compatibility while improving the overall user experience.
