# ✅ AI Features and Report Section - FIXED!

## Problem Solved
The AI features and Report section are now available for Pro Plan users. The issue was that the `PlanRestrictionGuard` component was hardcoded to always use the Basic Plan for authenticated users, ignoring recent Pro Plan payments.

## What Was Fixed

### **🔧 Root Cause:**
The `PlanRestrictionGuard` component was hardcoded to always return the Basic Plan for authenticated users, just like the audit page was. It wasn't checking localStorage for recent Pro Plan payments.

### **✅ Solution Implemented:**
Updated `PlanRestrictionGuard` to check localStorage for recent Pro Plan payments before falling back to the Basic Plan.

## Technical Changes

### **PlanRestrictionGuard.tsx Updates:**
```typescript
// Check localStorage for recent Pro Plan payment first
try {
  const paymentData = localStorage.getItem('pro_plan_payment')
  if (paymentData) {
    const payment = JSON.parse(paymentData)
    // Check if payment is for this user and recent (within last 24 hours)
    if (payment.userId === user.id && 
        payment.planId === 'pro' && 
        (Date.now() - payment.timestamp) < 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
      console.log('PlanRestrictionGuard: Found recent Pro Plan payment for user:', user.id)
      const proPlan = getPlanById('pro')!
      setUserPlan(proPlan)
      
      if (requiredFeature) {
        const hasFeatureAccess = proPlan.limits[requiredFeature] === true
        setHasAccess(hasFeatureAccess)
        console.log('PlanRestrictionGuard: Pro Plan feature access for', requiredFeature, ':', proPlan.limits[requiredFeature], 'hasAccess:', hasFeatureAccess)
      } else {
        setHasAccess(true)
      }
      return
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error checking localStorage payment:', error)
}
```

## Features Now Available for Pro Plan

## How It Works

### **Feature Access Flow:**
1. **User has Pro Plan payment** stored in localStorage
2. **PlanRestrictionGuard checks** localStorage first
3. **Finds recent Pro Plan payment** → Uses Pro Plan
4. **Checks feature permissions** → Pro Plan has `aiRecommendations: true` and `exportReports: true`
5. **Grants access** to AI features and Report section

### **Pro Plan Features:**
```typescript
limits: {
  aiRecommendations: true,      // ✅ AI features enabled
  competitorAnalysis: true,     // ✅ Competitor analysis enabled
  exportReports: true,          // ✅ Report export enabled
  historicalData: true,         // ✅ Historical data enabled
  // ... other Pro Plan features
}
```
